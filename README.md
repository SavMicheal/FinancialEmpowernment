# FinancialEmpowernment - Financial Inclusion & Churn Analysis Project

## 📊 Project Summary

This project explores financial inclusion and user behavior through a simulated database called **InclusiveFinanceDB**. It was inspired by my passion for using data and technology to solve real-world problems — particularly in underserved communities — and aligns with the mission of organizations like **Volition Cap** that aim to democratize wealth creation.

The database simulates community-based financial group structures, user demographics, savings behaviors, and transactional patterns, allowing for deep analysis of **churn**, **KYC (Know Your Customer) challenges**, and **income-level dynamics**.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Structure

The database consists of 3 main tables:

- **Groups** – 15 financial groups across various regions, focus areas, and activity metrics.
- **Users** – 300 simulated users with attributes like age, income, gender, KYC status, and churn behavior.
- **Transactions** – 350,000 messy financial transactions to allow data cleaning, fraud detection, and trend analysis.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Objectives

- **Churn vs Income Level** – Identify whether lower-income users are more likely to churn.
- **Churn vs KYC Status** – Explore how failed KYC attempts impact user retention.
- **Transaction Data Cleaning** – Fix typos, handle nulls, and correct inconsistencies in transaction records.
- **Insight Generation** – Derive actionable strategies to improve user onboarding, reduce churn, and support inclusive finance.

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** – Data generation, cleaning, and analysis.
- **T-SQL** – For procedural data manipulation.
- **Power BI (Planned)** – For building visual dashboards to communicate findings.

## 🌍 Why This Matters

Millions of people remain excluded from formal financial systems. This project simulates a real-world scenario to investigate how data can drive **smarter decision-making**, **inclusive product design**, and **sustainable wealth-building tools**.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Develop Power BI dashboards to visualize churn trends.
- Build predictive models for churn using Python (optional).
- Suggest data-driven interventions to improve KYC completion rates.
